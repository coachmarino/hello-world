# hello-world
This is a new repository from a complete and utter noob...trying to reinvent myself at almost 40 years of age

I am learning programming so that I can perhaps find a new career.  I'm also going brush up on my math skills for data analysis.  I am as noob as noob gets...good luck to me.
